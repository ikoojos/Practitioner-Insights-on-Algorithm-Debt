**Background** Algorithm Debt (AD), is a Technical Debt type that arises from suboptimal algorithmic choices, impacting system reliability. Despite the impact of AD affecting scalability and model degradation and the rapid evolution of Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) systems, it remains underexplored.

**Objective** To bridge this gap, in this study we investigated the causes, effects, and mitigation strategies of AD in ML/DL systems. 


**Methods** Using concurrent mixed-methods, we analysed 65 questionnaires and conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with ML/DL practitioners.

**Results** We found a limited awareness of AD among practitioners with causes varying by roles. We identified the complexity of ML/DL algorithms (78\%) as the major cause. Poor model scalability was the dominant effect, with systemic testing (71\%) as key mitigation strategy.

**Conclusion** This study confirmed AD as a distinct TD type, and offered practical guide to practitioners on how to (e.g., training of practitioners, implementing scalable algorithmic designs) mitigate AD in practice. Future research should focus on developing automated automated tools for AD detection to enhance the long term reliability of ML/DL systems.
