**Background** Algorithm Debt (AD), is a Technical Debt type that arises from suboptimal algorithmic choices, impacting system reliability. Despite the impact of AD affecting scalability and model degradation and the rapid evolution of Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) systems, it remains underexplored.

**Objective** To bridge this gap, in this study we investigated the causes, effects, and mitigation strategies of AD in ML/DL systems. 


**Methods** Using mixed-methods, 65 questionnaires were analysed and conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 ML/DL practitioners.

**Results** We found a limited awareness of AD among practitioners with causes varying by roles and identified a lack of knowledge and the complexity of ML/DL algorithms as the major causes. Poor model scalability was the dominant effect, with continous education and training as key mitigation strategy.

**Conclusion** This study confirmed AD as a distinct TD type, and offered practical guide to practitioners on how to (e.g., training of practitioners, implementing scalable algorithmic designs) mitigate AD in practice.
